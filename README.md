# CoWin2.0

### CoWin2.0 is a project that provides a nice and soothing interface for a user to check if there are any vaccines available near them.

### The above can be done by a user easily, using their location's PIN code or the name of their district if it is present in the CoWin database(PIN code is always safer).

## For Developers :

- This Project uses NextJS, a React Framework for frontend, planning to use Django-Rest-Framework for the backend if any need arises.
- Styling is done using _styled-components_ and _material-ui_.
- Themeing is done using _material-ui_, where theme switching utilises _redux_.
